## 🗂 Project Management Tool Options
We will evaluate and justify the selection of a project management tool:

| Tool        | Pros                                 | Cons                                |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Monday**  | Easy Kanban, checklist integration   | Limited reporting                   |

✅ **Selection Justification:** *We chose `Monday` for simplicity, collaboration features, and visual workflow clarity. However, we remain open to switching as the project scales.*
